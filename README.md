# Telco-Customer-Churn-Prediction
Implemented a complete machine learning workflow to predict customer churn on the Telco Customer Churn dataset, including preprocessing of categorical features, supervised classification modeling, performance evaluation, and feature importance analysis.

📌 Objectives :

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Apply feature engineering with a leakage-free approach

Build baseline and advanced models (Logistic Regression)

Compare model performance using Accuracy Score, Confusion Matrix, and classification metrics

Interpret model behavior with feature importance

🧠 Key Highlights :

Careful handling of categorical variables

No data leakage throughout the pipeline

Focus on business-relevant churn recall

📈 DataSet Include : 

customerID, gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents, tenure, PhoneService, MultipleLines, InternetService, OnlineSecurity, OnlineBackup, DeviceProtection, TechSupport, StreamingTV, StreamingMovies, Contract, PaperlessBilling, PaymentMethod, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges, Churn.
